# ScopedLabs — Design & Product Intent

ScopedLabs is a professional, technical tool platform.
It is NOT a marketing site, not a SaaS dashboard, and not flashy.

Design goals:
- Calm, premium, restrained
- Confidence through clarity, not animations
- Feels like an engineer’s tool, not a startup pitch

Structural intent:
- Categories are disciplines, not features
- Each category stands on its own
- One free anchor builds trust
- Pro tools answer the next uncomfortable question
- Long horizontal rows imply depth and seriousness

What this site should feel like:
- “This was built by someone who’s done this in the field”
- “I trust these numbers”
- “Nothing here is accidental”

What we avoid:
- Gamification
- Bright colors for attention
- Redundant UI patterns
- Reinventing layouts per page
- Over-explaining obvious things

If something feels flashy, clever, or salesy — it’s wrong.
If something feels boring but solid — it’s probably right.
