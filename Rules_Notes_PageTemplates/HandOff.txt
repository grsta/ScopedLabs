🧭 The safest possible handoff (do this exactly)
Step 1 — Close this tab (you need to)

You’re right to do it. 1.3 GB means Chrome is choking.

Step 2 — Open a new chat

First message:
Atlas resume: SCOPEDLABS_CORE_PROJECT_SCOPE_v1.0

Then immediately follow with:

“This document is authoritative.
Resume context, do not redesign, do not expand scope.”

We are locking the Camera Storage Calculator template.
I will paste the authoritative project scope next.

Step 3 — Paste the scope

Then we continue exactly where you left off, but without:

CSS ghosts

Whack-a-mole regressions

Browser instability

🧠 Why this actually works (important)

You’re not asking me to “remember everything”.

You’re doing something smarter:

Freezing intent

Freezing design philosophy

Freezing tool boundaries

That’s how senior engineers hand off projects — not by dumping files.



SCOPEDLABS_CORE_PROJECT_SCOPE_v1.0
ScopedLabs
Project Scope, Objectives, Architecture & Design Specification

Version: 1.0 (Foundation Lock)
Status: Authoritative Reset Document

1. Project Overview

ScopedLabs is a professional-grade, web-based toolkit platform designed for security professionals, system designers, and technicians to plan, validate, and communicate infrastructure decisions before installation.

The platform focuses on engineering reality, not vendor marketing:

Storage sizing

Retention planning

RAID impact

Survivability under failure

Bandwidth & performance modeling

Power & infrastructure planning (future phases)

The goal is to eliminate late-stage surprises like:

“Retention is short”
“Exports don’t fit”
“We need more drives”
“This NVR can’t handle peak load”

2. Core Philosophy
Design Principles

Clarity over cleverness

Engineering realism over theoretical maximums

Progressive complexity

Free tools = anchors & education

Pro tools = risk modeling & edge cases

One tool = one responsibility

Templates first, features second

Non-Goals

No scraping

No vendor lock-in

No product recommendations

No accounts or logins (Phase 1)

No real-time integrations

3. Target Users

Security system designers

CCTV / NVR technicians

Consultants

Engineers doing pre-sales validation

Advanced DIY users who want correct math

5. Visual & UI Design Lock
Color Scheme

Primary background: Near-black / graphite

Accent color: Neon green (status, pills, buttons)

Text: Off-white / muted gray

Borders: Subtle green glow

Philosophy: “Dark lab console”, not SaaS dashboard

UI Components (Standardized)

.card — content container

.tool-row — clickable category tool

.pill — status label (Free / Pro / Advanced)

.label-row — input label + help hint

.hint — contextual help modal trigger

.form-grid — two-column inputs

.results — structured output block

No per-tool styling deviations.
All tools inherit the same template.

6. Global Behavior (Locked)
Help System

Every input label has a ? hint

Uses a single global modal

Help text explains:

What the input means

What typical values are

When the user should use a different tool

Script Loading

/assets/app.js — global UI logic (nav, modals, helpers)

Tool-specific script.js — calculation logic only

Tool logic must not touch layout

7. Tool Definitions (Authoritative)
7.1 Camera Storage Calculator (FREE)

Purpose:
Provide a fast, realistic storage estimate using average bitrate, recording mode, and retention.

Inputs

Camera count

Average bitrate per camera (Mbps)

Recording mode (Continuous / Motion-based)

Motion active percentage (only if motion-based)

Retention days

Overhead / safety margin %

Outputs

Per-camera storage per day

Total storage per day

Total retention storage

Status indicator (OK / Moderate / Heavy)

Rules

Uses average bitrate only

Explicitly warns against peak bitrate misuse

Acts as the anchor tool for the category

7.2 Advanced Storage Planner (PRO)

Purpose:
Model non-average scenarios that break systems in real life.

Planned Capabilities

Peak bitrate modeling

Export workload simulation

Mixed codec scenarios

Burst activity windows

Retention compression under load

Multiple profile comparisons

Status

Placeholder shell page

Clearly labeled “Pro / Advanced”

No broken links

7.3 RAID Capacity & Failure Impact (PRO)

Purpose:
Explain what RAID actually does to usable capacity and survivability.

Planned Inputs

Drive count

Drive size

RAID level

Hot spare presence

Outputs

Usable capacity

Fault tolerance

Capacity loss during rebuild

Risk notes

7.4 Retention Survivability Estimator (PRO)

Purpose:
Show how failures degrade effective retention, not just capacity.

Concept

“You sized for 30 days — what happens when a drive fails?”

Time-based survivability modeling

8. Category Page Rules (Where Current Issues Came From)
Category pages (like Video & Storage) MUST:

Use only .tool-row links

Never embed cards or alternate layouts

Never include tool logic

Never differ in row structure

Each tool row has:

[ Tool Name + Description ]        [ Pill ]


Any deviation = layout instability.

9. Implementation Order (Reset Plan)

Lock Camera Storage Calculator template

Freeze Video & Storage category layout

Confirm all tool links resolve (even placeholders)

Duplicate template for next categories

Add Pro tool logic later without touching layout

10. End Goal (Very Important)

ScopedLabs is not a “calculator site.”

It is:

A reference platform

A design validation companion

A pre-install risk detector

If someone uses ScopedLabs and says:

“This caught something before it became a problem”

Then the project is successful.

11. Hand-Off Summary (for another agent)

Build a dark-themed engineering tool platform called ScopedLabs.
Follow strict layout templates.
No per-tool UI creativity.
One global help system.
One responsibility per tool.
Free tools educate.
Pro tools model risk.
Never mix layouts.
Never fix logic with CSS.
Templates are sacred.
